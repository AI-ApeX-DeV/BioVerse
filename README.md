## Soroban SDK
We utilized the Soroban SDK to develop the PolyFund smart contract for BioVerse, enabling efficient and secure fundraising for conservation projects. The contract includes features like setting funding targets, managing contributions, and ensuring transparency through contributor voting. Key functionalities include:

- Initialization: Setting up the funding manager, target amount, deadline, and minimum contribution.
- Contribution Management: Accepting funds from contributors and updating their balances.
- Voting and Requests: Allowing contributors to vote on fund requests and ensuring majority support for payments.
- Refunds: Providing refunds if the funding target is not met by the deadline.
